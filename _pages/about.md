I am currently a third-year (2023-2026) master student in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) and Shenzhen Institue of Advanced Technology (SIAT), under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OSDCB0UAAAAJ">Prof. Chao Dong</a>. Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in Shandong University in 2023.
